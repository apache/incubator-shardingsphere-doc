<h2 id="exploration-and-expansion-of-the-apache-shardingsphere-community">Exploration and expansion of the Apache ShardingSphere community</h2>
<p>Apache ShardingSphere community was invited to attend the Apache Event-join Apache open source community held by at Tsinghua University on November 9th. As an honored speaker, Liang Zhang, the PPMC, gave a talk named exploring and expanding the Apache ShardingSphere community. The main points of this topic are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="01-why-open-source">01 Why open source?</h3>
<p>For individuals, you can gain a better career and find enjoyment.</p>
<h4 id="a-better-career">A better career</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>More career opportunities. Industries can establish the cloud platform and provide business services through open-source projects. Besides, by contributing to the open-source community, industries can enhance their technical influence. Since industries can benefit from open source, many of them are hungry for open-source talents. The open-source job is always technique-related and community-based, which relatively makes your schedule listen to yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better capability. By contributing to the open-source community, you can improve not only technical skills but also soft skills like Language skills, social skills, and marketing skills. In addition, you will achieve innovation ability as well,  if you have a chance to create a brand new open-source project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great personal relationship. You will not only focus on your job, salary, KPI, e.t. Those industry-related activities, such as attending a seminar,  tech sharing, writing blogs, even tech investing, will attract your attention. Besides, you can also communicate and make friends with foreign people worldwide in the international open-source community. As this phrase said, engage your body familiar with job skills; engage your mind closed to the world. The open-source experience will bring you more potential opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earned public recognition. The effort of open-source work you did is totally open to anyone at any time, which means you can gradually receive public recognition. In contrast, the effort of in-company work is supposed to be judged by your leaders themselves, not the public, which means an inadequate evaluation is likely to give.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="an-enjoyable-career">An enjoyable career</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Self-growth. If you enjoy doing one work, you will grow up with pleasure. As a software engineer, you should learn to enjoy your work and be a self-driven person, which is the real shortcut to success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accomplishment sense. When your work is recognized by others, when your work made the project better and better, when you got new skills, you will strongly feel the sense of accomplishment and the pleasure of your career.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="02-what-is-the-apache-software-foundation">02 What is the Apache software foundation?</h3>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation is a non-profit organization. In the last 20 years, countless projects affecting the software industry have been produced. Among the hundreds of Apache Software Foundation projects, we can see several very famous projects: Apache Tomcat, Apache Commons, Apache Maven, Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Apache Zookeeper, etc. The Apache Software Foundation&rsquo;s projects have become the cornerstone of developers&rsquo; daily work. If you have not heard of any of the above projects, it is difficult to get company&rsquo;s Java backend or Big Data Offer.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been more and more Apache projects from China. By now, 19 projects from China have entered the Apache Software Foundation, 9 of which have graduated as top-level projects, and 10 of which have entered incubation. For those who have not multicultural experiences, the threshold for participating in an international open source project is a bit high. Therefore, the Apache Software Foundation projects from China benefit people who want to participate in open source projects. These projects can provide an opportunity for who are new to the community and cannot find a way to quickly enter the international open source community in native language. The Apache Software Foundation project from China is no different from the Apache Software Foundation project from the west in terms of processes, specifications, and legal affairs. The only difference is that you can find more Chinese-speaking people in the community. It will help you better understand the operation mode of the Apache community, to lay a solid foundation for future participation in other international projects.</p>
<h3 id="03-what-is-apache-shardingsphere">03 What is Apache ShardingSphere?</h3>
<p>Apache ShardingSphere is one of 19 Apache Software Foundation projects from China and is currently in the incubator. Apache ShardingSphere is a micro-kernel and highly scalable database middleware. Its core is small and stable, but it provides an infinitely extensible platform, so it is very suitable for growing with an open community and expanding its range of functions almost infinitely.</p>
<p>Apache ShardingSphere has been open sourced for almost 4 years, and its external use is quite extensive. Currently, more than 100 companies have clearly stated that they are in use. There are countless companies that have not stated but in fact in use. The companies that have been recorded cover all walks of life, including the Internet, Internet finance, online education, corporate services, and even government agencies. Apache ShardingSphere is slightly different from the purely community-raised project. It is donated by the company to the Apache Software Foundation. It has been widely used within the company, covering Jingdong white bars, super accounts, urban computing, second-level monitoring, Jingdong Financial Cloud, JD Big Data, JD Overseas Mall and many other systems. Relative to a freely developing community, Apache ShardingSphere also needs stability.</p>
<h3 id="04-apache-shardingsphere-community-statistics">04 Apache ShardingSphere Community Statistics</h3>
<p>For an open source project, the community is as important as the project itself. Therefore, both the project and community are part of the Apache ShardingSphere. Apache ShardingSphere officially entered the Apache Software Foundation incubator on November 10, 2018. It has been exactly one year so far. In the past year, the data of community activity has changed significantly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mailing list data changes</li>
</ol>
<p>Only the <a href="mailto:dev@shardingsphere.apache.org">dev@shardingsphere.apache.org</a> mailbox is counted here. The dev mailbox is the main way for community communication issues. In May 2019, there were 53 emails, 20 topics and 14 participants. The data include 15 emails forwarded by GitBox from GitHub, so the actual number of emails is 38. In September 2019 it has been significantly increased, including 148 emails, 34 topics and 37 participants. Besides, we have removed the GitBox forwarded mail from the dev mail group amd transferred to <a href="mailto:notification@shardingsphere.apache.org">notification@shardingsphere.apache.org</a> mailbox.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>GitHub data changes</li>
</ol>
<p>From the beginning of the project to open source to the time around June 2018, the overall peak and trough of the data is almost in line with my personal submission data. This shows that before entering the Apache Software Foundation, the ShardingSphere project was a highly personal project. Its success and failure were tied to individuals and the risks of the project were completely taken by one or a few people. From October 2019 to November 2019, you can see that 33 people participated in the project, 100 pull requests were merged, 167 issues were closed, 36 issues were created, a total of changes 591 files were added, 12021 lines of code were added and that 6577 lines of code were deleted. It can be seen that Apache ShardingSphere has changed from a personal project to a community project. The project controlled by the community has less risk and faster progress. The number of GitHub stars has increased by more than 4,000 in the past year, from 5000+ before entering the Apache Foundation to 9000+ now.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Changes in community data</li>
</ol>
<p>When entering the Apache incubator, ShardingSphere&rsquo;s project management committee had a total of 11 members. Except for the members of the project management committee, there were no official submitters in the community. After a year, the current project management committee members increased by 2 to 13 and there were 7 new official submitters. Over the past year, the number of contributors participating in the project has increased from 37 to 88. The number of participants is still growing. In the future, the ShardingSphere community will promote more official committers from these contributors and also promote more project management committee members from the official committers.</p>
<h3 id="05-the-core-ideas-of-the-apache-shardingsphere-community">05 The core ideas of the Apache ShardingSphere community</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Community is better than code. This is something that the Apache community has repeatedly emphasized. Our concern is not just code. The best code is built by people. We hope to build an active community and the active community will work together to build an active code base. An active community will gradually improve the functionality and quality of the entire code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect and trust the collaborators. We believe that the person who actively participates in the open source community is because he is willing to do and is willing to do well with enthusiasm. Therefore, we will respect each collaborator and cherish the contribution of each collaborator. At the same time, we also believe in each collaborator and grant them the maximum authority. Here we need to explain in particular that the collaborators and the junior contributors are different. The collaborators need to obtain the recognition of other collaborators through longer-term participation. Identifying trusted collaborators is one of the important tasks of the open source community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated testing. With more and more contributors, the code submission will become more and more frequent. Relying on manpower to control the final quality will become more and more uncertain. The ShardingSphere community puts more emphasis on reducing the probability of error through automation. The automated testing framework can ensure that contributors do not submit code with fear. As long as the automated testing is correct, the correctness of the code can be guaranteed. Automated testing allows participants to enjoy the process of contributing code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a self-service channel. As the project is used by more and more users, various problems will occur. It may be a bug of the project, a problem of the user itself or caused by unclear documentation. Therefore, it is important to create a self-service channel. Through documents and FAQs, users can solve most problems in a self-service manner. When there are unsolvable problems, you can find the core developers of the community through email, GitHub, or even WeChat group to further communicate and exchange problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open and remote working mode. Only open discussion on the mailing list or GitHub will be considered a problem that has already occurred. The community will not deal with private communications and commitments. The community hopes that all issues and resolutions will be publicly available. Remote collaboration means that there is no need for collaborators to be geographically concentrated, which means that work is asynchronous. It requires information exchange to explain the context clearly and describe as many problems as possible with one message at a time, thereby further promoting the communicator&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation provides a community maturity assessment model from the seven aspects of code, copyright, release, quality, community. unanimous resolution and product independence. At present, Apache ShardingSphere has completed the evaluation and passed the evaluation of all 34 sub-projects.</p>
<h3 id="06-increase-the-activity-of-the-apache-shardingsphere-community">06 Increase the activity of the Apache ShardingSphere community</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Project structure adjustment. Apache ShardingSphere is composed of database protocol layer, SQL layer, distributed transaction layer and storage layer at the technical structure level. At the functional level it is composed of many functions such as sharding, high availability governance, data desensitization, and read-write separation. The current ShardingSphere architecture is being adjusted to a completely SPI-based architecture. Extending any technology or implementing any function will not affect other functions. For example, Apache ShardingSphere&rsquo;s support for SQL will be completely separated according to the dialect of the database. The changes of the parsing part of MySQL have no impact on other databases. Therefore, ShardingSphere can support many contributors to contribute code at the same time without conflicting with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project guide. Apache ShardingSphere provides a lot of guides for contributors, allowing potential contributors to learn how to participate in the Apache ShardingSphere community. These guides include email subscription guide, contributor guide, submitter guide, publishing guide, and documentation guide, which basically cover all the elements of participating in the community. The community is also working on the contribution guide related to the technical module. The current testing framework and SQL parsing guidelines are in progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specification. Great importance is attached to standardized code. Therefore, the code specification is also an important part of the Apache ShardingSphere project. While the community provides code specification documents, it also provides code inspection tools such as checkstyle. Codes that do not meet the specifications cannot be passed by continuous integration tools. Therefore, they cannot be merged into the development backbone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demarcation of demand boundaries. Apache ShardingSphere itself is an active community as well as JD&rsquo;s basic database middleware that supports a lot of online applications. Therefore, the scenarios of the project are split into company and community. In the company scenario, the function will strive to maintain stability, have a higher priority and have a deadline for project submission. In the community scenario, we will maintain a continuous open mindset. The priority is moderate. As a team of JD.com’s Apache ShardingSphere, we are also a part of the community. While participating in the community, we will use the stable version of Apache ShardingSphere within the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diverse communication channels. In addition to email and GitHub issues, the community also provides WeChat groups for communication. In particular, email and GitHub are always the basis for core developers to deal with problems. WeChat communication is inconvenient to archive and secondary query, so it is only used for further communication. If the user does not create a problem through email or GitHub, the core developer will not directly feedback through WeChat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many ways to contribute to the community, including but not limited to sharing (speech, articles), answering questions, participating in discussions, investigating issues, website design, document updates, article document translation, code submission, community operations and promotion. Code submission is just one of many ways to contribute. Warmly welcome students who are willing to participate in the community to contribute to the community in a diversified manner and increase the feelings of self-worth.</p>
<p>May the Apache ShardingSphere community be one of your candidates for participation.</p>
